            <div class="content">
              <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Stanford University, 
                where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors John Duchi and Scott Linderman. 
                My research is focused on building reliable and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems with applications in 
                Neuroscience. I develop methods to make machine learning models robust to shifts in distribution and able 
                to accurately relate their own uncertainty. 
                Although this work as myriad applications—in areas ranging from cancer screening to language generation—
                the driving goal is to improve Brain-Computer Interfaces.
                BCIs have shown great promise in giving patients the ability to speak again after years of paralysis, but so far their reach has been slowed by problems with 
                calibration and reliability. 
                Although I am now firmly rooted in machine learning and statistics, I will always have a mind for connections to the fields that made me fall in love with research: chemistry, physics, and economics.
                Previously, I have conducted research in computational physics and molecular dynamics, worked in AI and Cybersecurity at Darktrace—applying Bayesian statistics to network security—
                and was the first STEM concentrator to be the Editor-in-Chief of the Brown Political Review.
                Outside of research, I used to say I enjoy hockey, triathlons, and reading, but since coming to Stanford my free-time has mostly been spent either playing tennis or trying to overcome my deficiencies in statistical knowledge. 
                As part of this desire to improve my statistical knowledge, I created a Bayesian model to predict pitcher performance for my fantasy baseball league, winning three of the past four seasons (Spencer Strider and Ronald Acuña's frailty really destroyed me one year).</p>
              
              <p>I am always happy to chat about research, statistics, or anything else. If you are ever around Stanford, I'd love to grab a coffee or hit a couple rallies on the tennis courts. </p>
